# What is the USU Bot Universe?

The USU Bot Universe is a free and open source chatbot-communication-protocol published and administrated by the USU GmbH.
The USU Bot Universe represents a chatbot-communication-protocoll which provides a universal communication format based on JSON for any kind of chatbot.
The concept divides chatbots into two roles, expert and lead bots.
The expert bots are chatbots that have been registered in the universe and can provide information on specific topics.
The other class, the lead bot, is the entry-level chatbot that first communicates with the user and assigns a matching expert bot.
The lead bot acts as a kind of moderator, whereas the expert bot is responsible for actually answering the question.
In the course of the project, interfaces for many different chatbots based on different technologies will be developed in order to create a way to connect them to the USU Bot Universe.
The vision of the USU Bot Universe is to combine chatbots and create entire chatbot networks.

# Contributing
The USUBotUniverse only advances through community contributions.

The best way to make changes is by submitting a Pull Request. For more information on how you can contribute, please see the [Contributing workflow](https://github.com/USUBotUniverse/USUBotUniverse/wiki/Contributing-workflow).

The USUBotUniverse specification is entirely community driven, however it is overseen by a governance committee. For more information please see the [Governance](https://github.com/USUBotUniverse/USUBotUniverse/wiki/Governance) documentation.
