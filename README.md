What is the USUBotUniverse?
--------------------------
The USU-Bot-Universe represents a bot-communication-protocoll which provides a universal communication format for any chatbots.
The concept divides chatbots into two roles, expert and master bots.
The expert bots are chatbots that have been registered in the universe and can provide information on specific topics.
The other class, the master bot, is the entry-level chatbot that first communicates with the user and assigns a matching expert bot.
The master bot acts as a kind of moderator, whereas the expert bot is responsible for actually answering the question.
In the course of the project, interfaces for many different chatbots based on different technologies will be developed in order to create a way to connect them to the USU Bot Universe.
The vision of the USU-Bot-Universe is to combine chatbots and also to create entire chatbot networks.
